#### Five Years of Collaborative Drug Discovery in the Cloud

Speaker: Barry A. Bunin, PhD Affiliation: Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA, 94010<br>
Time: 1 pm - 2 pm Date: Wed., Nov 25, 2009 Location: Atkinson Pavilion, Faculty Club<br>
Host: Wilfred W. Li, Ph.D. Email: Wilfred@ucsd.edu Phone: 858 534 0591 National Biomedical Computation Resource UCSD

Abstract: Collaborative Drug Discovery hosts a widely used drug
discovery data cloud platform. The CDD Vault is a secure, private
industrial-strength database combining traditional drug discovery
informatics (registration and SAR) with social networking capabilities.
CDD Collaborate enables real-time collaboration by securely exchanging
selected confidential data. Traditional drug discovery capabilities
include the ability to import/export to Excel(TM) and sdfiles, Boolean
queries for potency, selectively, and therapeutic windows for small
molecule enzyme, cell, and animal data, substructure and Tanimoto
similarity search, physical chemical property search, as well as IC50
calculation/curve generation, heat-maps, and Z/Z statistics for
archived data (protocols, molecules, plates, hyperlinked files). CDD
Public has unique, constantly growing drug discovery SAR content. The
CDD Vault, Collaborate, and Public together allow, for example,
literature Tuberculosis, gene-family-wide, and private SAR data to be
simultaneously queried with commercial compounds for screening (~3M).
Case studies from neglected infectious disease (Malaria, TB, African
Sleeping Sickness, etc) and secure traditional commercial drug discovery
with global teams of researchers in virtual pharmaceutical companies and
between companies (i.e. PI3 Kinase inhibitors for NSCLC) will be
presented.

Biography: Dr. Barry Bunin, CEO & President of Collaborative Drug
Discovery Inc. (www.collaborativedrug.com) helps scientists in secure
collaborative groups more rapidly develop drug candidates for commercial
and humanitarian markets. Dr. Bunin and CDD received funding in 2008 to
support a global community of leading TB researchers from the Gates
Foundation (BMGF). He co-authored "Chemoinformatics: Theory, Practice,
and Products", a text that overviews modern chemoinformatics
technologies and "The Combinatorial Index", a widely used text on
high-throughput chemical synthesis. Dr. Bunin was an
Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Eli Lilly and the founding CEO, President,
& CSO of Libraria. In the lab, Dr. Bunin did medicinal chemistry
developing patented new chemotypes for protease inhibition at Axys
Pharmaceuticals and RGD mimics to inhibit GP-IIbIIIa at Genentech. Dr.
Bunin received his Ph.D. at Berkeley, where he synthesized and tested
the initial 1,4-benzodiazepine libraries with Professor Jonathan Ellman.

#### Modeling the mesoscopic length scale of excitation-contraction coupling: the dyadic cleft

Abstract:

Ca2+ signaling in the dyadic cleft plays an important role in the
excitation contraction (EC) coupling in ventricular myocytes. The cleft
is a fuzzy space between T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). An
action potential triggers the opening of L-type Ca2+ channels that let
Ca2+ ions into the cleft. Most of the ions diffuse into the cytosol; but
some bind to ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are situated in clusters
at the SR membrane, triggering further Ca2+ release from SR. The signal
is conveyed by a small number of diffusing Ca2+ ions, and is therefore
fundamentally stochastic. The small number of Ca2+ ions involved in the
process would suggest that diffusion in the dyadic cleft have to be
modeled using Random Walk methods, making a deterministic and continuous
model of diffusion useless. However the signal is not conveyed by Ca2+
ions inside the cleft but rather by Ca2+ ions binding to single RyRs. To
study the mesoscopic scale for this process we compared the event of
single Ca2+ ions binding to RyRs in the cleft using two different models
of diffusion: a stochastic and discrete Random Walk (RW) model, and a
deterministic continuous model. We investigate whether the latter model,
together with a stochastic receptor model, can reproduce binding events
registered in fully stochastic RW simulations. By evaluating the
continuous model goodness-of-fit, for a large range of parameters, we
present evidence that it can. We found that it is not the average number
of ions in the solution that determine the mesoscopic scale for the
binding process, but rather the turnover rate of the participating ions
compared to the binding rate to single receptors that have to be high.

#### Computational Challenges in Models of Cardiac Electrophysiology

Affiliation: Simula Research Laboratory, Norway<br>
Host: Andrew D. McCulloch, Chair and Prof. of Bioengineering Dept, NBCR, UCSD<br>

Abstract:

The Bidomain model of cardiac electrophysiology poses a series of
mathematical and numerical challenges. We will discuss efficient
solution of the model. In particular we will address questions of
efficient solvers for the linear systems and the cell-models that arise
when the system is solved using finite elements combined with operator
splitting. We will consider the problem of simulating defibrillation
that is known to introduce additional difficulties to the problem.
Furthermore, we will discuss the computational complexity of the
Bidomain model compared to the somewhat simpler Monodomain model.

Finally, we will discuss an application of the methods to simulate
radiofrequency ablation that is used as a clinical approach to cure
atrial arrhythmias. The problem of simulating radiofrequency ablation
poses one unorthodox PDE problem that will be given particular
attention. The problem is to incorporate a continuous stream of data
into a problem originally defined as an initial boundary value problem.
